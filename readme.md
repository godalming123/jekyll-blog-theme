# jekyll-blog (very WIP)
A simple from-scratch blog that doesn't need any JS, is extremely fast and has a bold design.
## TODO:
 - add coloring to code blocks
 - small refinements in the design, typography, ETC
 - copy button for code blocks
 - external icon on links that point to external websites
## DONE:
 - 404 page - maybe just change the spacing between 404 and the text
 - get all of the markdown elements looking correct
 - home page
 - posts page
